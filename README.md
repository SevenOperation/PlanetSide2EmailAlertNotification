# PlanetSide2EmailAlertNotification
This is a tiny script which sends you an email if an alert is happening in planetside2 on a given server in a given time range.

# What you need
You only need a ServiceId for the census api from daybreak, a machine which the script can run on and access to a mail server.

# How to use it?
First of all you need a Service ID which you can get from here: http://census.daybreakgames.com/#devSignup.
Then all you need to do is download the project from github, if you done this via zip unpack it. Set your settings in the yaml file and then start it (You also have to download the python packages before) or if you don't wan't to download them yourself and write into the yaml file just execute the setup.sh file, which will guide you to the settings. I used python3.6 for it so if you wan't to make sure it is working you should use the same.

## Example
If you are very lazy or you just don't wan't to let your system run all the time and so on you are welcome to create an account at
https://www.wearethegamers.de/ then go to profile add a email address and configure your ps2 alert settings.Currently only Cobalt is used for alerting on my website.

If you find any bugs or have a cool idea for the alerting system or for my website let me know.
by sending an email to sevenoperation@wearethegamers.de or just write the idea into the wishlist on my website.
